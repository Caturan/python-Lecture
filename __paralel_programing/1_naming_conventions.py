    Python does not have strict rules, howewer we should follow some naming conventions to improve the quality and readability of our code. 
"""

"""
Names to Avoid:
    Never use characterr l(lowercase letter el), O(uppercase letter oh), or I(uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names. 
"""

"""
Packages: 
    Packages are folders including the modules. Their names should be short, all lowercase names without underscores. 
    Examples: numpy, matploblib, selenium
"""

"""
Modules: 
    Modules are single Python files, which can include some classes or functions and to be imported to some other Python files or run directly. 
    Their names should be short, all-lowercase names, can have underscores. 
    Examples: random, memory_profiler
"""

"""
Classes:
    Class names should follow the CapWords(upper camel case) convention. 
    Examples: MyClass, RandomNumberGenerator, CustomSchedule
"""

"""
Function:
    Function names should follow the snake_case convention. 
    Example: generate_coordinates, calculate_result
"""

"""
Variables: 
    Variable names should follow the snake_case convention. 
    Example: final_value, x_mean, thread_counter
