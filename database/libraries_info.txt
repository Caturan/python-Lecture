Libraries for Working With Other SQL Databases
    If we have a particular type of SQL database that we would like to access through Python, 
    most of the basic syntax is likely to be identical to what we just learned for SQLite. 

    - pyodbc: which connects to ODBC (Open Database Connection) databases, such as Microsoft SQL Server
    - psycopg2: which connects to the PostreSQL database
    - PyMySQL: which connects to MySQL databases 

    The SQLAlchemy package is another popular option for working with databases. 
    SQLAlchemy is an object-relational mapping, or ORM, that uses an object-oriented paradigm to build database queries. 
    It can be configured to connect to a variety of databases. 
    The object-oriented approach allows us to make queries without writing and raw SQL statements.
