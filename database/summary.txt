Summary
    We learned how to interact with the SQLite database
    that comes with Python. SQLite is a small and light SQL database that
    can be used to store and retrieve data in your Python programs. To
    interact with SQLite in Python, you must import the sqlite3 module.

    To work with an SQLite database, you first need to connect to existing database, or create a new database, with the sqlite3.connect()
    function, which returns a Connection object. Then you can use the
    Connection.cursor() method to get a new Cursor object

    Cursor objects are used to execute SQL statements and retrieve query
    results. For example, Cursor.execute() and Cursor.executescript() are
    used to execute SQL queries. You can retrieve query results using the
    Cursor.fetchone() and Cursor.fetchall() methods.
