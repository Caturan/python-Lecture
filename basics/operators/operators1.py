# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. 

"""
-Python Arithmetic Operators-
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations: 

+   Addition        x + y
-   Substraction    x - y
*   Multiplication  x * y
/   Division        x / y
%   Modulus         x % y
**  Exponentiation  x ** y

"""

"""
-Logical Operators-
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements: 
and     Returns true if both statements are true
or      Returns true if one of the statements is true
not     Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true
"""

"""
Identity Operators 
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
is      'Returns true if both variables are the same object'
is not  'Returns true if both variables are not the same object'
"""


"""
Membership Operators 
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:
in       'Returns true if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object'
not in   'Returns true if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object'
