# Varibles are containers for storing data values. 

# Python has no command for declaring a variable. 
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. 

x = 5
y = "Cevdet"
print(x)
print(y)

# Variables do not need to be declared wth any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set. 

k = 4
k = "Zeynep"
print(k)

# If we want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting. 

q = str(3)  # will be '3'
w = int(3)  # will be 3
e = float(3) # will be 3.0

# We can get the data type of a varaible with the type() function. 

r = 7
t = "DÃ¼nya"
print(type(r))
print(type(t))

# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes: 
y = "Pen"
